  (After importing the apocalypse.sql , check if the 3 tables(contamination,survivor,resource) have been created 
- Make sure you update your database credentials in application.properties file
- After running the application on your local machine, you can access the API swagger documentation via http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
